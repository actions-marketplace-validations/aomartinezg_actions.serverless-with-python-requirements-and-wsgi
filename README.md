# Serverless with Python Requirements and WSGI

Same as [serverless-with-python-requirements](https://github.com/dhollerbach/actions.serverless-with-python-requirements) but includes the installation of the serverless-wsgi plugin.

Javascript action that runs a Serverless deploy using the serverless-python-requirements and serverless-wsgi plugins.
